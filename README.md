# Warehouse-workshop

Let’s imagine that we want to build a program that manages all of the inventory in a shop.

We’d like it to
Know how many of each item we have in stock
Allow a customer to add items to a basket (and then purchase all the items)
Allow the manager to order new stock
Produce a report of the stock and what got sold in the last week.


As a group, let’s see if we can come up with a collection of classes that could help us build something like this, and work out how those classes would interact with each other.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61541702/171163291-bc7db58e-c932-4a14-9022-636527735655.png)
